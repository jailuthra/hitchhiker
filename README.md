#HitchHiker

**This is still a work in progress**

HitchHiker is a web app for sharing rides in a fun, easy and safe way. Our vision is to transform carpooling into a viable transportation alternative, one which allows passengers to travel with comfort and security, while saving costs and reducing fuel emissions significantly.

The problem with most social ridesharing apps is that they group you with strangers. Hence for women, they're not a viable alternative to travelling alone, and not suitable for everyday commute for either gender. Making ridesharing exclusive to a single organization is our solution to this problem, thus ensuring safety and familiarity.

Seeing the problems day scholars face while commuting everyday to and fro college, we decided to implement a first version of HitchHiker exclusively for the students of IIIT Delhi. We are looking to expand to other colleges in the future as well!
