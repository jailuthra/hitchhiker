#HitchHiker

HitchHiker - Connecting car owners and co-travellers to share city-to-city journeys.
HitchHiker is an online ridesharing application created for people to share rides in a fun, easy and safe way. Our vision is to transform carpooling into a viable transportation alternative, one which allows passengers to travel with comfort and security while saving costs significantly.
Driven by the problems day scholars face while commuting everyday to and fro college, we decided this to implement a first version of HitchHiker exclusively for the students of IIIT Delhi.
